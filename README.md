# Seamless Intro

Seamless is a family of AI models that enable more natural and authentic communication across languages. SeamlessM4T is a massive multilingual multimodal machine translation model supporting around 100 languages. SeamlessM4T serves as foundation for SeamlessExpressive, a model that preserves elements of prosody and voice style across languages and SeamlessStreaming, a model supporting simultaneous translation and streaming ASR for around 100 languages. SeamlessExpressive and SeamlessStreaming are combined into Seamless, a unified model featuring multilinguality, real-time and expressive translations.

# Quick Start
## Installation
> [!NOTE]
> One of the prerequisites is [fairseq2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq2) which has pre-built packages available only
> for Linux x86-64 and Apple-silicon Mac computers. In addition it has a dependency on [libsndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile) which
> might not be installed on your machine. If you experience any installation issues, please refer to its
> [README](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq2) for further instructions.

```
pip install .
```

> [!NOTE]
> Transcribing inference audio for computing metric uses [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper#setup), which is automatically installed. Whisper in turn requires the command-line tool [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers.


## Running inference

### SeamlessM4T Inference
Hereâ€™s an example of using the CLI from the root directory to run inference.

S2ST task:
```bash
m4t_predict <path_to_input_audio> --task s2st --tgt_lang <tgt_lang> --output_path <path_to_save_audio>
```
T2TT task:
```bash
m4t_predict <input_text> --task t2tt --tgt_lang <tgt_lang> --src_lang <src_lang>
```
Please refer to the [inference README](src/seamless_communication/cli/m4t/predict) for detailed instruction on how to run inference and the list of supported languages on the source, target sides for speech, text modalities.

For running S2TT/ASR natively (without Python) using GGML, please refer to [the unity.cpp section](#unitycpp).

### SeamlessExpressive Inference
> [!NOTE]
> Please check the [section](#seamlessexpressive-models) on how to download the model.

Hereâ€™s an example of using the CLI from the root directory to run inference.

```bash
expressivity_predict <path_to_input_audio> --tgt_lang <tgt_lang> --model_name seamless_expressivity --vocoder_name vocoder_pretssel --output_path <path_to_save_audio>
```

Here's how you should do a foward pass through the speech encoder:

```python
import torch

from fairseq2.data.audio import AudioDecoder, WaveformToFbankConverter
from fairseq2.memory import MemoryBlock
from fairseq2.nn.padding import get_seqs_and_padding_mask
from fairseq2.data import Collater
from pathlib import Path
from seamless_communication.models.conformer_shaw import load_conformer_shaw_model


audio_wav_path, device, dtype = ...
audio_decoder = AudioDecoder(dtype=torch.float32, device=device)
fbank_converter = WaveformToFbankConverter(
    num_mel_bins=80,
    waveform_scale=2**15,
    channel_last=True,
    standardize=True,
    device=device,
    dtype=dtype,
)
collater = Collater(pad_value=1)

model = load_conformer_shaw_model("conformer_shaw", device=device, dtype=dtype)
model.eval()

with Path(audio_wav_path).open("rb") as fb:
    block = MemoryBlock(fb.read())

decoded_audio = audio_decoder(block)
src = collater(fbank_converter(decoded_audio))["fbank"]
seqs, padding_mask = get_seqs_and_padding_mask(src)

with torch.inference_mode():
  seqs, padding_mask = model.encoder_frontend(seqs, padding_mask)
  seqs, padding_mask = model.encoder(seqs, padding_mask)
```

## Evaluation

### SeamlessM4T Evaluation
To reproduce our results, or to evaluate using the same metrics over your own test sets, please check out the [README here](src/seamless_communication/cli/m4t/evaluate).
### SeamlessExpressive Evaluation

Below is the script for efficient batched evaluation.

```bash
export MODEL_DIR="/path/to/SeamlessExpressive/model"
export TEST_SET_TSV="input.tsv" # Your dataset in a TSV file, with headers "id", "audio"
export TGT_LANG="spa" # Target language to translate into, options including "fra", "deu", "eng" ("cmn" and "ita" are experimental)
export OUTPUT_DIR="tmp/" # Output directory for generated text/unit/waveform
export TGT_TEXT_COL="tgt_text" # The column in your ${TEST_SET_TSV} for reference target text to calcuate BLEU score. You can skip this argument.
export DFACTOR="1.0" # Duration factor for model inference to tune predicted duration (preddur=DFACTOR*preddur) per each position which affects output speech rate. Greater value means slower speech rate (default to 1.0). See expressive evaluation README for details on duration factor we used.
expressivity_evaluate ${TEST_SET_TSV} \
  --gated-model-dir ${MODEL_DIR} --task s2st --tgt_lang ${TGT_LANG} \
  --audio_root_dir "" --output_path ${OUTPUT_DIR} --ref_field ${TGT_TEXT_COL} \
  --model_name seamless_expressivity --vocoder_name vocoder_pretssel \
  --text_unk_blocking True --duration_factor ${DFACTOR}
```

Please check out this [README section](docs/expressive/README.md#automatic-evaluation)

### SeamlessStreaming and Seamless Evaluation

[Streaming Evaluation README](src/seamless_communication/cli/streaming) has detailed instructions for running evaluations on the SeamlessStreaming and Seamless models.

## Unity.cpp
To enable Seamless Communication Everywhere, we implemented unity.cpp so users could run SeamlessM4T models in GGML - a C tensor library allowing easier integration on verbose platforms.

To transcribe/translte a given audio,

```
./ggml/bin/unity --model seamlessM4T_medium.ggml input.wav
```

For details of build and more usage please check out [unity.cpp](ggml)

## Expressive Datasets

We created two expressive speech-to-speech translation datasets, mExpresso and mDRAL, between English and five other languages -- French, German, Italian, Mandarin and Spanish. We currently open source the speech-to-text of mExpresso for out-of-English directions, and we will open source the remaining part of the datasets soon. For details, please check out [README](docs/expressive/README.md#benchmark-datasets)

### SeamlessAlignExpressive
Weâ€™re introducing the first expressive speech alignment procedure. Starting with raw data, the expressive alignment procedure automatically discovers pairs of audio segments sharing not only the same meaning, but the same overall expressivity. To showcase this procedure, we are making metadata available to create a benchmarking dataset called SeamlessAlignExpressive, that can be used to validate the quality of our alignment method. SeamlessAlignExpressive is the first large-scale (11k+ hours) collection of multilingual audio alignments for expressive translation. More details can be found on the [SeamlessAlignExpressive README](docs/expressive/seamless_align_expressive_README.md).


## Converting raw audio to units
Please check out the [README here](src/seamless_communication/cli/m4t/audio_to_units). Note that SeamlessM4T v1 model uses reduced units and other models use non-reduced units.

# Libraries

Seamless Communication depends on 4 libraries developed by Meta.

## [fairseq2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq2)
fairseq2 is our next-generation open-source library of sequence modeling components that provides researchers and developers with building blocks for machine translation, language modeling, and other sequence generation tasks. All SeamlessM4T models in this repository are powered by fairseq2.

## [SONAR and BLASER 2.0](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SONAR)
SONAR, Sentence-level multimOdal and laNguage-Agnostic Representations is a new multilingual and -modal sentence embedding space which outperforms existing sentence embeddings such as LASER3 and LabSE on the xsim and xsim++ multilingual similarity search tasks. SONAR provides text and speech encoders for many languages. SeamlessAlign was mined based on SONAR embeddings.

BLASER 2.0 is our latest model-based evaluation metric for multimodal translation. It is an extension of BLASER, supporting both speech and text. It operates directly on the source signal, and as such, does not require any intermediate ASR system like ASR-BLEU. As in the first version, BLASER 2.0 leverages the similarity between input and output sentence embeddings. SONAR is the underlying embedding space for BLASER 2.0. Scripts to run evaluation with BLASER 2.0 can be found in the [SONAR repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SONAR).

## [stopes](https://github.com/facebookresearch/stopes)
As part of the seamless communication project, we've extended the stopes library. Version 1 provided a text-to-text mining tool to build training dataset for translation models. Version 2 has been extended thanks to SONAR, to support tasks around training large speech translation models. In particular, we provide tools to read/write the fairseq audiozip datasets and a new mining pipeline that can do speech-to-speech, text-to-speech, speech-to-text and text-to-text mining, all based on the new SONAR embedding space.

## [SimulEval](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SimulEval)
SimulEval is a library used for evaluating simulaneous translation models. SimulEval also provides a backend for generation using partial/incremental inputs with flexible/extensible states, which is used to implement streaming inference. Users define agents which implement SimulEval's interface, which can be connected together in a pipeline. You can find agents implemented for SeamlessStreaming [here](src/seamless_communication/streaming/agents).

## [Legacy] SeamlessM4T v1 instructions
#### Finetuning SeamlessM4T v1 models
Please check out the [README here](src/seamless_communication/cli/m4t/finetune).

#### On-device models
Apart from Seamless-M4T large (2.3B) and medium (1.2B) models, we are also releasing a small model (281M) targeted for on-device inference. To learn more about the usage and model details check out the [README here](docs/m4t/on_device_README.md).

#### SeamlessAlign mined dataset
We open-source the metadata to SeamlessAlign, the largest open dataset for multimodal translation, totaling 270k+ hours of aligned Speech and Text data. The dataset can be rebuilt by the community based on the [SeamlessAlign readme](docs/m4t/seamless_align_README.md).
